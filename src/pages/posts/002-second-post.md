##Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript which you will learn about in later posts.

HTML is basically a skeleton for every Web based application. Just like ABC in english HTML is a basic necessity for all of you none the matter front-end or back-end.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages

#####HTML elements are represented by <> tags

```


 The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

 The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page

 The lang attribute  defines the language of the document

 The <meta> element contains meta information about the document

 The charset attribute defines the character set used in the document

 The <title> element specifies a title for the document

 The <body> element contains the visible page content

 The <h1> element defines a large heading

 The <p> element defines a paragraph
