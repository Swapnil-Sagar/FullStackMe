CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It alongside with styling, It can also postition, change attribute and animate the selectors using their classname, id or tag name. 

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

`body `

`{`
 ` background-color: lightblue;`

`h1 `

`{`
  `color: white;`
  `text-align: center;`
`}`
